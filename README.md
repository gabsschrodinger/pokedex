# Pokedex

Pokedex app made with pure JS, based on the video made by Roger Melo (Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/rogermelojs). In the video, he uses 2 API's: one for getting pokemon names and ID's, and other for the pokemon images. I added a third API for the images of the pokemon types (poison, fire, etc.) and used even more data of the first API (HP, Attack and Defense).
